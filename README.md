# Responsive Web Design Projects

Contained within this repository are my resolutions for the [Responsive Web Design certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/mapocalypse/responsive-web-design) challenges by freeCodeCamp. These projects were formulated in 2020 as a strategy to reacquaint myself with HTML and CSS, marking the beginning of my career transition into the field of IT.

[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a non-profit organization that consists of an interactive learning web platform, an online community forum, chat rooms, online publications and local organizations that intend to make learning software development accessible to anyone.
