      <h2>The author</h2>
      <p>José Maria de Eça de Queiroz (25 November 1845-16 August 1900) is generally considered to have been the
        greatest Portuguese writer in the realist style. Zola considered him to be far greater than Flaubert.In the
        London Observer, Jonathan Keates ranked him alongside Dickens, Balzac and Tolstoy. During his lifetime the
        spelling was Eça de Queiroz, and this is the form that appears on many editions of his works; the modern
        standard Portuguese spelling is "Eça de Queirós". For this page, we will respect the spelling used during his
        lifetime.</p>
      <p>At age 16, he went to Coimbra to study law at the University of Coimbra; there he met the poet Antero de
        Quental. Eça's first work was a series of prose poems, published in the Gazeta de Portugal magazine, which
        eventually appeared in book form in a posthumous collection edited by Batalha Reis entitled Prosas Bárbaras
        ("Barbarous texts"). He worked as a journalist at Évora, then returned to Lisbon and, with his former school
        friend Ramalho Ortigão and others, created the Correspondence of the fictional adventurer Fradique Mendes, first
        published in 1900.</p>
      <p>In 1869 and 1870, Eça de Queirós travelled to Egypt and watched the opening of the Suez Canal, which inspired
        several of his works, most notably O Mistério da Estrada de Sintra ("The Mystery of the Sintra Road", 1870),
        written in collaboration with Ramalho Ortigão, in which Fradique Mendes appears. A Relíquia ("The Relic") was
        also written at this period but was published only in 1887. The work was strongly influenced by Memorie di Giuda
        ("Memoirs of Judas") by Ferdinando Petruccelli della Gattina, such as to lead some scholars to accuse the
        Portuguese writer of plagiarism.</p>

      <p>When he was later dispatched to Leiria to work as a municipal administrator, Eça de Queirós wrote his first
        realist novel, O Crime do Padre Amaro ("The Sin of Father Amaro"), which is set in the city and first appeared
        in 1875.</p>

      <p>Eça's politics were of the Liberal stamp, although he was also influenced by the ideas of Pierre-Joseph
        Proudhon.[6] In 1898, upon growing more pessimistic about the future of Portugal and Europe, he described
        himself as a "vague, saddened anarchist."</p>

      <p>He died in 1900 of either tuberculosis or, according to numerous contemporary physicians, Crohn's disease. He
        was first buried in a family vault in Prazeres Cemetery and later exhumed and moved to a grave in Santa Cruz do
        Douro Cemetery, in Baião Municipality, Portugal</p>
